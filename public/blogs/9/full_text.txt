Python Performance Tip: Use `is` Instead of `==` for None, True and False Checks!

When comparing to None, True and False, using `is` can speed up your code. Hereâ€™s a quick example using timeit.

Results (for 10M repeats):
`==`: 0.318 sec
`is`: 0.214 sec (about 30% faster!)
These small improvements add up, especially in larger codebases. Check out the code snippet below!
