Understanding Python Stack Frames 🐍

Every time you call a function, Python creates a stack frame to keep track of it. Think of it like layers of a stack, where each frame holds the function name, variables, and a link to the previous one.

In these slides, I’ve broken down:
👉 How stack frames work.
👉 How to inspect them using inspect.
👉 A cool visualization of frames in action.

Check it out and let me know what you think!
