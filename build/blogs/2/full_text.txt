I've just completed my GitHub repository, asynchronous-python, where I've covered nearly everything you need to know about async programming in Python. And the best part? You don't need to be a Python expert‚Äîit's beginner-friendly and designed for all skill levels.

üìö In Chapter 7, I explore a critical area: ASGI vs. WSGI for Python web application. WSGI has been the go-to standard for running Python web apps synchronously, but with the increasing demand for real-time applications, ASGI offers a powerful alternative, supporting asynchronous processing, HTTP/2, and WebSockets.

üîç Looking for insights beyond web apps?
As a backend developer, my focus has been on web applications, but I recognize there's so much more potential for async Python in areas like ML and data analysis. I'm open to contributions and collaboration to expand this repository further‚Äîlet's build it together!

Check out the attached slides for a quick overview of ASGI vs. WSGI, and if you find this useful, please give my repo a star on GitHub! üåü
