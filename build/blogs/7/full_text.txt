Boosting Async Performance in Newer Python Versions ðŸš€ 

Recent Python releases include some documented enhancements for asynchronous programming! In this documentation link https://aligheshlaghi97.github.io/asynchronous-python/chapter6/ , I showcase practical examples that apply these features and achieve significant async speedups:

1. Eager Task Creation: In Python 3.12, eager_task_factory speeds up asynchronous task handling by at least 4x compared to traditional gathering methods, ideal for high-load systems needing fast task creation.

2. Faster asyncio.current_task Calls: Python 3.12 also optimizes asyncio.current_task calls by 4-6x, enabling quicker task trackingâ€”something async frameworks will benefit from greatly.

While these improvements were highlighted in CPythonâ€™s GitHub and official documentation, I havenâ€™t seen many real-world implementations. Sharing these practical gains might be useful to those following asyncio advancementsâ€”Jason Brownlee, this may be of interest to SuperFastPython!
Staying updated with new Python features can offer significant speedups for our workflows.
